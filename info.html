Start by selecting a puzzle template, and fill in the puzzle grid. You can select the size of your puzzle through
the <i class="fas fa-gear"></i> settings tab. Once you are ready, press the solve button to see your puzzle's results.
You can let the website sort words into required and bonus by adjusting the "Frequency Cutoff" in the settings tab.
All words with a frequency less than the set cutoff will be counted bonus. The frequency cutoff goes from 0 to 10,
decimals included. Be on the lookout for <i>awkward words!</i> These words are counted as "sensetive words" in Squaredle.
Make sure your puzzle doesn't have too much. You can the sensitive words present in your puzzle through the "Read Full Analysis"
button after your puzzle is solved. When you're done, be sure to save your puzzle through the <i class="fas fa-save"></i> button!
