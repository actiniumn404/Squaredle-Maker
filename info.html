<h1>Information <span class="close">&times;</span></h1>
Squaredle Maker is a tool that helps create and test puzzles for the popular word game
<a href="https://squaredle.app" target="_blank">Squaredle</a>. This is not affiliated in any way with Squaredle LLC.
<br>
<br>
Start by selecting a puzzle template, and fill in the puzzle grid. You can select the size of your puzzle through
the settings tab (<i class="fas fa-gear"></i> icon in the action bar).
You can let the website sort words into required and bonus by adjusting the "Frequency Cutoff" in the settings tab.
All words with a frequency less than the set cutoff will be counted bonus. The frequency cutoff goes from 0 to 10,
decimals included.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes, your puzzle will inadvertently contain an "awkward word." These words may be counted as "excluded words" in
Squaredle. Make sure your puzzle doesn't have too many (or none if you manage it). You can the view the sensitive words
present in your puzzle through the "Read Full Analysis" button after your puzzle is solved.
<br>
<br>
When you're done, save your progress with the <i class="fas fa-save"></i> button!
<br>

<b>IMPORTANT: </b>Please do not use this tool to artificially gain a spot on the leaderboard. Not only is this no
fun for everyone else, your account might also get blocked for cheating by Squaredle.
